An R package implementing the methods of "Time-Varying Nonlinear Regression Models: Nonparametric Estimation and Model Selection" (Zhang and Wu 2015, AoS), created as part of the work for my Honors Senior Thesis for the Mathematics department at Boston University.

This repo (README included), are still a work in progress, with the goal to potentially publish this as an official CRAN package to live alongside Zhang and Wu's paper. In the meantime, more information on how the methods here work can be found by going to my blog post at
